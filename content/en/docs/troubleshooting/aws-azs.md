AWS team is providing AZ ID's rather than availability zone names in the service impact e-mails.

To assess the service impacts to the correct AZ, below information is needed.

{{<alert icon="⚠️" text="Below are AZ ID's for **us-east-1** region" />}}

| AZ Name     | AZ ID    |
| ----------- | ---------|
| us-east-1a  | use1-az4 |
| us-east-1b	| use1-az6 |
| us-east-1c	| use1-az1 |
| us-east-1d	| use1-az2 |
| us-east-1e	| use1-az3 |
| us-east-1f	| use1-az5 |
