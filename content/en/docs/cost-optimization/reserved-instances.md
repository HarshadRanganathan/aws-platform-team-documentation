The cloud is well suited for variable workloads and rapid deployment, yet many cloud-based workloads follow a more predictable pattern. 

For such applications, your organization can achieve significant cost savings by using Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Reserved Instances. 

Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances enable your organization to commit to usage parameters at the time of purchase to achieve a lower hourly rate. 

Reservation models are also available for Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon ElastiCache, Amazon OpenSearch Service (OpenSearch Service), Amazon Redshift, and Amazon DynamoDB. 

For more details please refer to [AWS Reservation Models](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cost-optimization-reservation-models/welcome.html) documentation.
