Error Using an SDK below the minimum recommended version will cause your app to fail with Unable to locate credentials error. This is because we have disabled IMDS v1 (Instance metadata service used by your SDK to get credentials) for security reasons.
Latest SDK versions use IMDS v2 for getting the credentials.</description></item><item><title>ECR</title><link>https://aws-platform-team-documentation.rharshad.com/docs/project-guidelines/ecr/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 21:54:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aws-platform-team-documentation.rharshad.com/docs/project-guidelines/ecr/</guid><description>Namespaces # Namespaces are a way to group similar repositories together.
e.g. team-a/web-app, team-b/web-app, project-a/web-app
Use:
Helps to scope IAM policies so that pods running in a cluster can only pull images from a particular name-spaced repositories.
Guidelines # ECR repositories should have namespaces for logical grouping.
Immutability # You can configure a repository to be immutable to prevent image tags from being overwritten.
This can thwart an attacker from overwriting an image with a malicious version without changing the image&amp;rsquo;s tags.</description></item><item><title>Container Logs</title><link>https://aws-platform-team-documentation.rharshad.com/docs/project-guidelines/container-logs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 21:55:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aws-platform-team-documentation.rharshad.com/docs/project-guidelines/container-logs/</guid><description>In the process of containerization, we should keep in mind that, the container is going to run anywhere in cloud environment.
In general, teams will use Kubernetes or any other services to run the containers.
These services have been enabled with built-in log forwarding of STDOUT/STDERR from containers to external services such as Cloudwatch, Splunk, ES etc.
So, it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to just write your logs to STDOUT/STDERR.
For example, you could have your log4j2.</description></item><item><title>Load Balancing</title><link>https://aws-platform-team-documentation.rharshad.com/docs/project-guidelines/load-balancing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 21:55:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aws-platform-team-documentation.rharshad.com/docs/project-guidelines/load-balancing/</guid><description>EKS # Mis-configured Load balancers can expose the service to the wider internet.
For full information on configuring a load balancer read the offcial k8s documentation.
Prevent Exposure to 0.0.0.0/0 # AWS load balancers are automatically exposed to the wider internet. To prevent this configure the load balancer with the following annotation providing your private subnet range:
service.beta.kubernetes.io/load-balancer-source-ranges: 10.0.0.0/16 Also, if you have any explicit annotation to 0.0.0.0/0 please remove it.</description></item><item><title>CI/CD</title><link>https://aws-platform-team-documentation.rharshad.com/docs/project-guidelines/ci-cd/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 21:55:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aws-platform-team-documentation.rharshad.com/docs/project-guidelines/ci-cd/</guid><description> CI/CD Jenkins Flow</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes Probes</title><link>https://aws-platform-team-documentation.rharshad.com/docs/project-guidelines/kubernetes-probes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 21:55:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aws-platform-team-documentation.rharshad.com/docs/project-guidelines/kubernetes-probes/</guid><description>We recommend that you set below probes for your deployment.
StartUp Probe # Note If the startup probe never succeeds, the container is killed after 300s and subject to the pod's restartPolicy. Set up startup probe with a failureThreshold * periodSeconds long enough to cover the worse case startup time
The kubelet uses startup probes to know when a container application has started.
If such a probe is configured, it disables liveness and readiness checks until it succeeds, making sure those probes don&amp;rsquo;t interfere with the application startup.</description></item></channel></rss>
